Dotfiles
===

This repository is home to my general purpose dotfiles for installations of Linux distros.

Most of this is self-explanitory however it is worth mentioning that in `./scripts/` there are two short shell scripts:

1. `./scripts/inst-zsh.sh` is for installing ZSH and using [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for customisation.
2. `./scripts/inst-bspwm.sh` is for installing [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) (and a couple of other tools) and configuring it to my liking.
