Dotfiles
===

This repository is home to my general purpose dotfiles for installations of Linux.

## Disclaimer

- The local font configuration (local.conf) is taken from this chap's [file](https://github.com/helmuthdu/dotfiles/blob/master/fonts.conf) but I hope to alter it as time goes on.

- Much of .bashrc is the default file provided with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). Though there are several custom changes but nothing dramatic.
